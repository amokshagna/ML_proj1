Classification of States by Industrial Potential

**Problem statement**: 
Classify states into categories such as "High Potential," "Medium Potential," and "Low Potential" based on their industrial data and performance metrics.

**Objective**: 
To classify states into High, Medium, or Low potential categories based on key industrial performance metrics for better resource allocation and policy-making decisions.

**Input** :
Number of factories, invested capital, total output, total emoluments, etc.

**Algorithm**:
Classification Algorithms (e.g., Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines)

**Expected Outcome**:
High/Medium/Low potential categories based on the value of output or net value added.
